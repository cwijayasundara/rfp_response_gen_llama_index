The successful awardee's fixed unit price information (CLIN x005 Portability Plan, x006 Portability Test, and x007 CCPO PM Support) and proposed catalog offerings will be incorporated into the resultant Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) contract and will serve as the basis for establishing overall task order (TO) pricing for the duration of the ID/IQ.\n\n2. Maximum. The maximum, as that term is used in FAR clause 52.216-22, is $10,000,000,000.00. Hence, the cumulative amount of all TOs issued under this contract shall not exceed $10,000,000,000.00.\n\n3. Minimum. The minimum guaranteed award amount for the JEDI Cloud ID/IQ Contract is $1,000,000.00. The exercise of any option does not re-establish the contract minimum guarantee.\n\n4. The Government has no obligation to issue TOs under the resultant ID/IQ contract beyond the amount specified in paragraph three.\n\n## Section B3: Task Order Contract Types\n\nThis single award ID/IQ contract allows for the placement of TOs by DoD warranted Contracting Officers. All TOs will be firm-fixed price.\n\n## Section B4: Travel\n\nTravel is not anticipated. However, if the JEDI Cloud Contracting Officer later determines that travel is necessary for TO performance under this ID/IQ, the contract will be modified accordingly.\n\n## Section B5: Security\n\nAll tasks in support of JEDI Cloud must be conducted IAW Attachment J-6, JEDI Cloud Cyber Security Plan; Attachment J-7, DD Form 254, DoD Contract Security Classification Specification for ID/IQ; and other security requirements in the contract. Future TO DD Form 254s are anticipated to be identical to Attachment J-7 with the exception of Block 16, Certification and Signature, and Block 17, Required Distribution. Each TO ordering activity will complete Blocks 16 and 17 as appropriate.\n\n# SECTION C: DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK\n\n## Section C1: Performance Work Statement\n\nID/IQ: The Offeror's Performance Work Statement (PWS), proposed in response to the Government's Attachment L-1 JEDI Cloud Statement of Objectives (SOO), will be incorporated into the contract as Attachment J-2. The Offeror shall meet all requirements of Attachment J-6, JEDI Cloud Cyber Security Plan. In the event of a conflict between the JEDI Cloud Cyber Security Plan and the PWS, the JEDI Cloud Cyber Security Plan takes precedence over the PWS. For administration purposes both the PWS and the JEDI Cloud Cyber Security Plan are listed as attachments in Section J. However, for the purpose of FAR 52.212-4(s), they shall be deemed incorporated into Section C1.\n\nAll Performance Metrics listed in the PWS shall apply to all TOs unless otherwise noted.

The Contractor shall provide overarching program management personnel, processes, and tools under CLINs x007 necessary to manage and oversee all contract activities for the duration of the ID/IQ within schedule, quality, and performance requirements. The Contractor shall establish and maintain a formal program management organization, which shall coordinate and interface with the CCPO. The Contractor shall appoint a Program Manager (PM) and Deputy PM empowered to make program and project level decisions and commit resources necessary to successfully execute courses of action within scope of this contract. Two key functions of the Contractor's program management support will be facilitating the timely authentication and authorization of JEDI Cloud infrastructure and offerings at all classification levels and coordinating successful integration of the DoD's provisioning tool. The PM and Deputy PM shall have sufficient expertise and authority to execute the following responsibilities as the authorized official: (a) serve as the official central point of contact and interface between the Contractor and the CCPO PM, (b) be available as needed for CCPO interaction, and (c) monitor and report on contract status (CDRL A001), Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and compliance with all contract requirements.\n\n2. The Government will use the Quality Assurance Plan (QASP) as one mechanism to oversee Contractor performance. A majority of TOs are unlikely to have TO-level QASPs; however, the Government retains the right to implement QASPs at the TO level. The Contractor's Quality Control Plan (QCP) (CDRL A010) will establish methodologies by which the Contractor will meet or exceed schedule, quality, and performance requirements.\n\n3. The Contractor shall implement a Small Business Participation Commitment Document (Attachment J-10). This will assist in the development of capabilities of small businesses and provide a maximum practicable opportunity to participate in efficient contract performance for small businesses. The Contractor shall report on small business participation in the Small Business Reporting (CDRL A013).\n\n## Section C3: Transition Out\n\n1. Transition Out Plan: When requested by the JEDI Cloud Contracting Officer, the Contractor will have up to 60 days to provide a Transition Out Plan (CDRL A002). The purpose of the Transition Out Plan is to explain to the CCPO the procedures necessary to transition either all or a part of the services under this contract, as directed by the Government. The Transition Out Plan shall describe detailed recommendations for maintaining continuity of services and preventing degradation of services during the transition period. The Transition Out Plan shall provide recommendations on how account holders may efficiently extract their application(s) and user data in a manner that is consistent with the Portability Plan. The Transition Out Plan shall address the unclassified environment, classified environment, and tactical edge offerings separately. Further, the Contractor shall explain the process to provide knowledge transfer to the CCPO and include job shadowing for up to 30 days, training, and other activities in order to successfully transition the environment to the new hosting environment. The Transition Out Plan shall include a process for identifying and destroying all classified infrastructure, materials, or information IAW CCPO instructions and the contract's security requirements.\n\n2. Transition Out Execution: The Contractor shall perform all activities as described in the approved Transition Out Plan, excluding extraction of applications and data, which is a user responsibility. The Contractor shall exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor. The Contractor shall deliver all technical data, computer software, and computer software documentation generated in the performance of this contract, to which the Government has rights. The Contractor shall execute knowledge transfer in accordance with the Transition Out Plan. When directed, the Contractor shall purge all unclassified materials and information and purge or destroy, as appropriate, all classified infrastructure, materials, and information IAW the Transition Out Plan.

The legally enforceable ability for the prime contractor to maintain control over certain parts of JEDI Cloud is critical to meeting the security requirements of this contract. The Government expects that it will need to direct the Contractor to affect alterations or configuration changes to JEDI Cloud for purposes of addressing critical security vulnerabilities. The Contractor must be able to decisively and rapidly respond in the interests of national defense. For the purpose of this section, the direction concerning critical security vulnerabilities may come from the DoD CIO in coordination with the JEDI Cloud Contracting Officer and CCPO PM.\n\n2. For purpose of this section, \"rapidly\" means in 8 hours or less from Government notification. All Government-directed alterations or configurations changes will be agreed upon by both the Government and the Contractor prior to implementation.\n\n3. Depending on the urgency of the circumstances, the agreed-to alteration or configuration change may initially be achieved by oral direction from the JEDI Cloud Contracting Officer, but to the extent it is deemed a \"change\" as defined by FAR clause 52.212-4(c), the change will be subsequently reflected in a written agreement of the parties as soon as practicable.\n\n4. Throughout the entire period of performance, the Contractor shall maintain control, as defined in this section, over the following parts of JEDI Cloud for both the unclassified and classified environments:\n   a. Underlying hardware infrastructure, including networking components within the data centers;\n   b. Underlying software layer, including the hypervisor and networking components;\n   c. Software platform offerings (excluding third-party marketplace offerings); and\n   d. Hardware and software components of all points of presence.\n\n5. \"Control\" means that, for the part of JEDI Cloud in paragraph 1 above, the prime contractor either:\n   a. Is the owner, as defined in this section, paragraph 6, as evidenced by self-certification. The Government may request additional documentation to prove ownership at any time and with any frequency throughout the period of performance; or\n   b. Has a bilaterally signed agreement (Control Agreement) that is binding for at least 11 years with the owner granting the prime contractor the following rights:\n      i.   Unrestricted physical access; and\n      ii.  An ability to rapidly affect changes to the owned parts.\n\nThis Control Agreement must state that it may not be terminated by the Owner without at least 120 days notice to the Government. The JEDI Cloud Contracting Officer may request confirmation that the Control Agreement has not been altered or terminated at any time.\n\n6. \"Owner\" means that, for the parts listed in paragraph 1, the entity has a legally enforceable claim or title, which includes the rights listed in sub-paragraphs 5.b.i and 5.b.ii. The owner must have a legally binding and recorded document evidencing ownership.\n\n## SECTION D: PACKAGING AND MARKING\n\nPackaging and Marking Requirements will be delineated in individual TOs.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, {"id_": "094d0178-da16-4f52-90c1-3de540d3c4f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "JEDI Cloud RFP # HQ0034-18-R-0077\n\n## SECTION E: INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE TERMS\n\nSupplies/services will be inspected/accepted at:\n\n| CLIN | INSPECT AT | INSPECT BY | ACCEPT AT | ACCEPT BY |\n|------|------------|------------|-----------|-----------|\n| 0001 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 0002 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 0003 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 0004 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 0005 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 0006 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 0007 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 1001 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 1002 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 1003 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 1004 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 1005 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 1006 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 1007 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 2001 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 2002 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 2003 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, {"id_": "25ee30b6-d8ce-4545-a7ca-5f1280798dad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "JEDI Cloud RFP # HQ0034-18-R-0077\n\n| Year | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n|------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|\n| 2004 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 2005 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 2006 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 2007 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 3001 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 3002 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 3003 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 3004 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 3005 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 3006 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n| 3007 | Destination | Government | Destination | Government |\n\n## SECTION F: PERFORMANCE\n\n### Section F1: Contract Period of Performance / Ordering Periods\n\nThe Period of Performance (PoP) of the resulting ID/IQ contract is structured as one continuous two-year base ordering period, two continuous three-year option ordering periods, and one continuous two-year option ordering period for a potential total of 10 years.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.\n(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.\n(ii) Examples.\n(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. \u00a76212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.\n(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. \u00a76320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.\n(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a76159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

Best value will be based on a detailed evaluation of all factors outlined below. In determining the best value, the Government may employ a tradeoff process allowing for an award to other than the Offeror proposing the lowest price or achieving the highest adjectival rating.\n\nA written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, furnished to the successful Offeror within the specified timeframe, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.\n\nWhen making the best value determination, only those Offerors who receive a rating of \"Acceptable\" for all of Factor 1 will be considered. The non-price factors, listed in descending order of importance, are as follows: Factor 2, Factor 3, Factor 4, Factor 5, Factor 8, Factor 6, and Factor 7. Non-price factors 2 through 8, when combined, are more important than Factor 9 Price. Factors 7 and 8 will only be evaluated after establishment of the competitive range. Price will become increasingly more important as the rating for each of the non-price factor ratings become increasingly equal. When the Offerors within the competitive range are considered essentially equal in terms of technical capability, or when Price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the technical superiority to the Government, Price may become the determining factor for award.\n\n## Section M2: Evaluation Process\n\nThe Government will employ a two-phase evaluation for this acquisition.\n\nUnder Phase One, the Government will evaluate the Offeror's Volume II, Factor 1, Gate Evaluation Criteria submission, against the \"Acceptable / Unacceptable\" criteria identified below in Table M-2. Offerors who receive a rating of \"Unacceptable\" under any of the Gate Criteria Sub-factors will not be further evaluated. Thus, as an example, if an Offeror is rated as Unacceptable for Gate Criteria Sub-factor 1.2, the remainder of the proposal will not be evaluated and will not be considered for award.\n\nUnder Phase Two of the evaluation process, the Government will evaluate the Offeror's proposal using the following steps:\n\n1. If the rating is \"Acceptable\" for all Sub-factors under Factor 1, Gate Evaluation Criteria, the Offeror's proposal for Factors 2 through 6 and 9 will be evaluated.\n\n2. Upon completion of the evaluation in Phase One and Phase Two step 1, a competitive range will be established. Those Offerors in the competitive range will be invited to provide a Volume IV, Factor 7 - Small Business Participation Approach, and Volume V, Factor 8 - Demonstration, and engage in discussions (in the event the Government engages in discussions).\n\n3. Factors 7 and 8 will be evaluated. Any Offerors for Factor 8 Demonstration that receive a rating of \"Marginal\" or \"Unacceptable\" for Technical Capability or a Risk rating of \"High\" shall be eliminated from the competitive range and the proposal will not be further evaluated.\n\n4. Upon completion of discussions (if any), any Offerors remaining in the competitive range will be requested to submit a final proposal revision (FPR). The FPR shall be deemed to include the already conducted Factor 8 Demonstration.\n\nJEDI Cloud Synopsis/Solicitation                                Page 88", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, {"id_": "eae6a4a9-2068-4634-8c06-9a6319dd180e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "JEDI Cloud RFP # HQ0034-18-R-0077\n\n5. The FPR will be evaluated IAW Section M. Any Offerors with a Risk Rating of \"High\" under any Factor shall be deemed unawardable. Any Offerors with an adjectival rating below \"Acceptable\" (see Tables M-3 and M-4) for any of the non-price factors (i.e., Factors 2 through 8) shall not be considered for award.\n\n6. Based on FPR evaluation, a best value determination will be made IAW Section M.\n\nDebriefings will be conducted IAW FAR Subpart 15.5 and Class Deviation 2018-O0011, Enhanced Postaward Debriefing Rights, dated 22 March 2018.\n\n## Section M3: Evaluation Factors\n\n### Factor 1 - Gate Evaluation Criteria\n\nOfferors' proposals will be evaluated for technical acceptability on an \"Acceptable / Unacceptable\" basis for each of the following sub-factors based on whether the proposal demonstrates the requirements articulated in each sub-factor IAW the respective instructions detailed above in Section L. Offerors' proposals must be rated \"Acceptable\" under all Factor 1 sub-factors in order to receive an overall rating of \"Acceptable\" for Factor 1 - Gate Evaluation Criteria. If a proposal is rated \"Unacceptable\" for any Gate Evaluation Criteria sub-factor, the evaluation process will immediately cease. The remainder of the proposal will not be evaluated and will not be considered for award.\n\n#### Sub-factor 1.1 - Elastic Usage\n\nThe Government will evaluate whether the proposal clearly demonstrates that the addition of DoD unclassified usage will not represent a majority of all unclassified usage, per the requirements in Section L for this sub-factor.\n\n#### Sub-factor 1.2 - High Availability and Failover\n\nThe Government will evaluate whether the proposal clearly demonstrates that CCO data centers are sufficiently dispersed and can continue supporting the same level of DoD usage in the case of catastrophic data center loss IAW the requirements in Section L for this sub-factor.
